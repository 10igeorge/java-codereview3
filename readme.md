#### Created By

## Description
This is the code review for week 3 of the Epicodus Java class featuring a faux hair salon, allowing the salon owner to add a list of stylists to the database and assign clients to each one. Utilizing the one-to-many attribute, stylists may have many clients, but clients may only have one stylist.

Enjoy!
